## Diamonds Dataset

The dataframe `diamonds` is a dataset containing the prices among a litany of other variables of around 54,000 diamonds. We will do some visualisations of this dataset using plotly.

First let's loads the data in and view its structure.

```{r, echo =TRUE, comment=""}
data("diamonds")
head(diamonds)
```

## Frequency density plot of price (seperated by quality)

```{r}
gg <- diamonds |> 
ggplot(aes(x= price, y = after_stat(density))) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(color = cut), binwidth = 500, linewidth = 0.75)

ggplotly(gg)
```

## Histogram of carat count

```{r}
hh <- diamonds |> 
ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)

ggplotly(hh)
```
